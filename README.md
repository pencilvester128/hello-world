# hello-world
This is my first attempt at learning version control for my projects. Bear with me. 

Hello Github world, 

My name is CJ Watkins and I am an aspiring developer. This whole new world is deeply intriguing but incredibly nebulous to approach. At this point its like drinking from a fire hose but I hope to pick up a little each day.
